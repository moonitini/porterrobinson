    <p> Porter Robinson's lyricism is characterized by its emotional depth and introspective themes. He often explores complex and personal narratives, delving into topics such as self-discovery, love, loss, and the human experience. Whether he's crafting anthemic choruses or intimate verses, his words have a way of connecting with audiences, offering glimpses into his inner world while also inviting listeners to reflect on their own emotions and experiences. Here are my favorites. </p>

                    Or else everything's in vain
                    When the glory tries to tempt you
                    It may seem like what you need
                    But if glory makes you happy
                    Why are you so broken up?"</p>

                    <p class="lyric"> "So tell me how it felt when you walked on water
                    Did you get your wish?"</p>
